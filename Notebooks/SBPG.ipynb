    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Small businesses in Ghana play a crucial role in driving the countryâ€™s economic growth, contributing significantly to GDP and employment. However, many of these businesses operate under financial constraints, lack access to data-driven decision-making, and face challenges in profitability and sustainability. This project analyzes a dataset simulating operational and financial records of small businesses across various regions in Ghana to uncover performance patterns and identify key factors influencing success.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the operational and financial structure of small businesses in Ghana.\n",
    "2. Identify and address data quality issues such as missing values and inconsistent formats.\n",
    "3. Engineer meaningful features to enhance model performance and insight generation.\n",
    "4. Apply data preprocessing techniques like scaling, encoding, and normalization.\n",
    "5. Generate actionable insights through visual analytics.\n",
    "6. Answer key business questions using machine learning and AI techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Small businesses in Ghana often lack the analytical tools to understand what drives or hinders their performance. By exploring and modeling this data, we aim to identify which factors (e.g., region, business type, education of owners, advertising spend) most significantly influence profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Small Business Owners:** Want to understand what contributes to profitability and growth.\n",
    "* **Policy Makers and Government Agencies:** Need insights for creating policies and support systems for SMEs.\n",
    "* **Financial Institutions and NGOs:** Use data to assess risk and fund businesses effectively.\n",
    "* **Data Analysts/Data Scientists:** Responsible for analyzing, cleaning, modeling, and interpreting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features (Key Parts of the Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numerical Features:** `revenue`, `expenses`, `advertising`, `employee_count`, `customer_satisfaction`.\n",
    "* **Categorical Features:** `region`, `business_type`, `owner_education`, `ownership_type`.\n",
    "* **Derived Features (to be created):** `profit` (revenue - expenses), `profit_margin`, `profit_per_employee`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Businesses with higher advertising expenditure tend to have higher profit margins.\n",
    "2. Owner education level positively correlates with business performance.\n",
    "3. Customer satisfaction is higher in certain business types or regions.\n",
    "4. Businesses in urban regions perform better financially than those in rural areas.\n",
    "5. Higher employee count does not always translate to higher profit per employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7 Business Questions (ML/AI-Driven) \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regression:** Can we predict the **profit** of a small business based on its revenue, expenses, region, and other features?\n",
    "2. **Classification:** Can we classify businesses as **profitable or not** based on operational metrics?\n",
    "3. **Clustering:** Can we segment businesses into meaningful **groups (clusters)** based on their financial and operational profiles?\n",
    "4. **Recommendation:** Which type of **advertising strategy** yields better profit outcomes across business types?\n",
    "5. **Customer Insight:** What features contribute to **higher customer satisfaction** scores?\n",
    "6. **Feature Importance:** Which features are most influential in predicting **business success**?\n",
    "7. **Anomaly Detection:** Can we detect **underperforming or risky businesses** based on outliers in profit or revenue?\n",
